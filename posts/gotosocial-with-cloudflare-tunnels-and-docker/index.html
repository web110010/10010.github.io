Personally I like this way more, since I find 3rd party clients much better.\nI use Tuba for desktop and Tusky for my phone.\n3rd party apps still have bugs, with GoToSocial and sometimes bug out.\nTusky doesn’t show my profile picture.\nFedilab just keeps on crashing for me.\nDocker Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[5] The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[6] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[7] ~ Docker (software) - Wikipedia\nIt containerizes apps and makes them easier to deploy and maintain. It is the most beautiful thing ever. Once you use it, you want everything to be a docker app. So simple so elegant.\nGet Started here: Overview | Docker Documentation\nA bit about Cloudflare Tunnels A good way to describe it for my purpose would be a cornered man’s port-forwarding. They do have their advantages in terms of security and ease of use and security compared to normal port forwarding.\nA cloudflare tunnel, routes a service, without needing port-forwarding or a publicly routable IP address. You can use it with CGNAT ip addresses!.\nThere are other more complex and desirable features that cloudflare provides with their cloudflare tunnels, you should check it out. Over the years cloudflare is one of the companies, I’ve truly had a good experience with.\nThere are other providers and self hosting options for this purpose available, I just use cloudflare because they are my domain registrar. The process for other providers should be similar. Their UI is also a joy to use albeit a bit slow.\nI use it at home because my ISP blocks port-forwarding and for my Oracle cloud instance. Oracle provides a free tier for hosting cloud instances, but the ways in which they have scarred me…. by using their god awful UI, laggy ssh sessions which kill themselves mid command, I could simply use an A name record to point to the oracle provided ip-address, but that is giving Oracle too much power.\nMy two cents about using Oracle:\nDon’t.\nIf there is no other choice, use as less of Oracle as possible.\nI applied to their pay as you go plan so that they don’t just delete my free instance, for “verification” they deducted 100 USD from my account, that scared the ever living shit out of me, until I got the message 1 minute later from my bank, that it was reversed. At least give a warning saying you will be checking for 100 USD, by deducting and refunding it.\nChecklist before starting A device with docker installed. (If the device is a windows machine, change the bash command to however they suit you, I have no idea how it works.)\nInternet connection.\nDomain name to point to. If using cloudflare ensure the domain is available at cloudflare. For other services, do whatever they say for you having the needed rights for pointing a domain name.\nInstructions Step 1: Create a user created bridge network in docker The default bridge network doesn’t allow using hostnames by default and you have to use the IP address instead. If you have an existing user created bridge network and want to use it, go ahead.\nOn your machine run:\ndocker network create -d bridge cloudflare-bridge\nwe will connect our GoToSocial instance to this network.\nStep 2: Setting up Cloudflare Zero Trust Login to your cloudflare account and select Zero Trust in the sidebar.\nSignup for a free account.\nStep 3: Create a tunnel Login to your Zero Trust account.\nOn the sidebar select Access then in the sub-menu Tunnels.\nSelect Create a tunnel, then name your tunnel and Save Tunnel.\nCopy your token. Do not close the webpage.\nStep 4: Installing cloudflared On your machine run replacing with your token:\ndocker run -d --restart unless-stopped --network cloudflare-bridge cloudflare/cloudflared:latest tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token Remember to add --network cloudflare-bridge\nI have WatchTower running in the background, so I am not sure how much --no-autoupate is working.\nOn your cloudflare tunnels page, scroll down to check if connector is connected. If it shows a connector hit save.\nStep 5: Pointing your domain name Choose whatever domain you want.\nIn Service add:\nType: HTTP\nURL: gts.docker:8080 (replace gts.docker with whatever hostname you want and 8080 with your desired port)\nSelect Save hostname.\nremove/change sub-domain as you see fit.\nStep 6: Installing GoToSocial On your machine create directory gotosocial and sub directory data and file docker-compose.yaml:\nAlternatively: follow the official docs and edit docker-compose.yml accordingly in next step.\n1 2 3 mkdir -p ~/gotosocial/data cd gotosocial touch docker-compose.yaml Paste the following in your docker-compose.yaml:\nEdit the following parameters:\nGTS_HOST\nGTS_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN, remove if you do not want account delegation. Having is makes your handle as @handle@example.com instead of @handle@gts.example.com.\npath/to/data should be the complete path, do not use ~ like ~/gotosocial/data , it errors out and the container keeps restarting. Read more about it here.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 version: \"3.3\" services: gotosocial: image: superseriousbusiness/gotosocial:latest container_name: gotosocial user: 1000:1000 hostname: gts.docker # Should be same as hostname of URL you added in step 5 networks: - gotosocial - cloudflare-bridge environment: GTS_HOST: gts.example.com # Change Me GTS_ACCOUNT_DOMAIN: example.com # Change Me GTS_DB_TYPE: sqlite GTS_DB_ADDRESS: /gotosocial/storage/sqlite.db GTS_LETSENCRYPT_ENABLED: \"false\" GTS_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL_ADDRESS: \"\" ports: - \"8080:8080\" # Should be same as port of URL you added in step 5 volumes: - /path/to/data:/gotosocial/storage #Change path restart: \"always\" networks: gotosocial: ipam: driver: default cloudflare-bridge: external: true Now simply docker-compose up -d or docker compose up -d, depending on whatever you have installed. Voila!! If you did everything correctly your GoToSocial instance should be up and running. Access it at gts.whatever-your-domain-is. Now go wild.\nBonus Round: Creating users To create a user:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID \\ /gotosocial/gotosocial \\ admin account create \\ --username some_username \\ --email someone@example.org \\ --password 'some_very_good_password' And then to promote the created user to admin:\n1 2 3 4 docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID \\ /gotosocial/gotosocial \\ admin account promote \\ --username some_username Further Reading I recommend reading the GoToSocial Documentation as it was quite helpful making this. Overall it is well-written, missing a few things here and there. You can also find further configuration options there.\n",

<p>GoToSocial provides a lightweight, customizable, and safety-focused entryway into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>, and is comparable to (but distinct from) existing projects such as <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a>, <a href="https://friendi.ca">Friendica</a>, and <a href="https://pixelfed.org/">PixelFed</a>.  <em>-<a href="https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial#what-is-gotosocial">GitHub - gotosocial</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simple words it is a simple micro-blogging application with connectivity to other fediverse applications.</p>
<p>It is also compatible with mastodon API.</p>

<p>There are quite a few reasons to run <em>GoToSocial</em> instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is simpler to run and very easy to setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal instances don&rsquo;t need a big heavy mastodon server.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It is still under development and is not feature complete with mastodon, plemora and other fediverse microblogging programs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have an integrated client front-end, basically you cannot post directly from the site. Personally I like this way more, since I find 3rd party clients much better.</p>

</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>3rd party apps still have bugs, with <em>GoToSocial</em> and sometimes bug out.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-cloudflare-tunnels">A bit about Cloudflare Tunnels<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-bit-about-cloudflare-tunnels">#</a></h2>
<p>A good way to describe it for <strong>my purpose</strong> would be a cornered man&rsquo;s port-forwarding. They do have their advantages in terms of security and ease of use and security compared to normal port forwarding.</p>
<p>A cloudflare tunnel, routes a service, without needing port-forwarding or a publicly routable IP address. You can use it with <em>CGNAT ip addresses!.</em></p>
<p>There are other more complex and desirable features that cloudflare provides with their cloudflare tunnels, you should check it out. Over the years cloudflare is one of the companies, I&rsquo;ve truly had a good experience with.</p>
<p>There are other providers and self hosting options for this purpose available, I just use cloudflare because they are my domain registrar. The process for other providers should be similar. Their UI is also a joy to use albeit a bit slow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use it at home because my ISP blocks port-forwarding and for my Oracle cloud instance. Oracle provides a free tier for hosting cloud instances, but the ways in which they have scarred me&hellip;. by using their god awful UI, laggy ssh sessions which kill themselves mid command, I could simply use an <code>A</code> name record to point to the oracle provided ip-address, but that is giving <em>Oracle</em> too much power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My two cents about using <em>Oracle</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no other choice, use as less of <em>Oracle</em> as possible.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I applied to their <strong>pay as you go</strong> plan so that they don&rsquo;t just delete my free instance, for <strong>&ldquo;verification&rdquo;</strong> they deducted 100 USD from my account, that scared the ever living shit out of me, until I got the message 1 minute later from my bank, that it was reversed. At least give a warning saying you will be checking for 100 USD, by deducting and refunding it.</em></p>
