      <description>This is my first post now and I do think this is going to be a journey.
Only time will tell where this voyage will take me. I hope as I do look at this post years later I will remember this post fondly. I hope to records some great records and maybe put out my thoughts and ideas about various things.
I wish this blog does turn itself into something and take a form of it own.</description>
